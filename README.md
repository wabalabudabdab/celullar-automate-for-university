# Cellular Automaton
A cellular automaton written entirely in `python3`. 
This project is aimed at studying the behavior of cellular automata under different "rules of the game".


## ALSO
Start config saved in start_config.txt
In project works with z3.txt and the final result will be saved there.

## DEPENDENCIES
The program works without dependencies if FRONT is disabled. Otherwise, the `pygame` library is needed.
